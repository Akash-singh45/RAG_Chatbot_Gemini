# RAG_Chatbot_Gemini

**Gemini Chatbot Pro** is an advanced AI-powered chatbot that leverages **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** and **large language models (LLMs)** to provide intelligent and context-aware responses. This chatbot is designed for various applications, including customer support, personal assistance, and knowledge retrieval.

- **Multi-Turn Conversations:** Maintains context across interactions for a more natural experience.
- **Customizable Knowledge Base:** Supports domain-specific training for tailored responses.
- **Streamlit UI:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for seamless communication.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Primary language)
- **Gemini API** for AI-driven responses
- **Streamlit** for interactive UI
- **Vector Databases** (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone) for retrieval-based responses
- **FastAPI / Flask** for API development
- **Docker** for containerization
